      I don’t just work in newsrooms; I build them. As a producer, journalist, and newsroom head,
      I spend my days creating processes that last, shaping stories that matter,
      and mastering technologies both old and new. For over 13 years, I’ve rolled up my sleeves in every corner of
      journalism — reporting, editing, production, design-thinking, storytelling — learning by doing and refusing to
      settle for anything ordinary.
      Print, digital, broadcast — I’ve collaborated with some of India’s most talented people and companies, creating
      identities, news pieces, experiences, and stories that stand their ground.

      This site isn’t a portfolio in the conventional sense. It’s a space beyond social streams, a workshop where I
      share ideas, experiments, and reflections. Here, you’ll see the curiosity, the rigor, and the stubbornness that
      drives my work — a place to explore how stories, systems, and platforms can
      be built, not just consumed.

      I focus on <span class="highlight">problem-solving</span>, staying
      <span class="highlight">consistent</span>, and building with purpose.
